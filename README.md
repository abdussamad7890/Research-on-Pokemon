# Research-on-Pokemon
Task 1 - Identified a Pokemon that is best suited for battle against Jolteon.  
Task 2 - The boxplot of HP across the different generations after removing the outliers.


## Description:
I have used Pandas, a Python library for cleaning and manipulating data. I have implemented certain concepts and focused on how to use Pandas for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Pandas is a really powerful library that anyone working with data in Python should be familiar with. 
I have also covered another oft-used library in Python for EDA - Seaborn. This library is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is also another powerful tool that should be in the toolkit of any budding data scientist/analyst.

### Outcomes:
I have applied basic EDA concepts using Pandas, a Python library.
I have also experienced using Pandas and Seaborn to answer EDA queries and presented a statistical graph using Seaborn library.
